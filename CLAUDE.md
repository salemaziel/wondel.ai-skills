# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of 65 agent skills for Claude, Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent and other agentskills.io-compatible agents. Skills provide specialized domain knowledge and frameworks for specific use cases (UX design, marketing, product strategy, sales, operations, positioning, virality, code quality, systems architecture, etc.). Twelve of them are **metaskills** — guided journeys that orchestrate the other skills step by step toward a goal.

The Codex plugin standard (`plugins/` + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` + `.codex/plugins/marketplace.json`) is **generated from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** by `scripts/generate-codex-plugins.sh` — same 10 collections, same skill membership, versions tracked automatically. Never hand-edit the generated trees.

## Skill File Format

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: 'Framework description based on Author''s "Book Title". Use when you need to: (1) first use case, (2) second use case, (3) third use case.'
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: wondelai
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# Skill Title

Intro paragraph about the framework.

## Core Principle

**Bold opening statement.** Foundation paragraph.

## Scoring

**Goal: 10/10.** Score with a reproducible rule tied to the Quick Diagnostic that spans the full 0-10 — e.g. `score = round(rows passed / N × 10)` — then spell out the 9-10 / 7-8 / 5-6 / <=3 bands. (Don't write "1 point per row" when there are fewer than 10 rows: the top band becomes unreachable.)

## Framework Sections

### 1. First Section

**Core concept:** ...
**Why it works:** ... (only when it states a real mechanism — cut if it just restates the Core concept)
**Key insights:** (bullet list of non-obvious points only)
**Product applications:** (table: Context | Application | Example)
**Copy patterns:** (bullet list with quoted examples)
**Ethical boundary:** ... (only when a concrete, behavior-changing constraint — omit platitudes the model already follows)
See [references/file.md](references/file.md) when <situation> — <what it adds>   (inline when-to-read pointer, at the point of need; no trailing roster)

## Common Mistakes
(Table: Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix)

## Quick Diagnostic

## About the Author

```

### Required Fields
- `name`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, max 64 chars)
- `description`: What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars). Use numbered use cases: `(1) ..., (2) ..., (3) ...`

### Recommended Fields (for marketplace)
- `license`: License name (we use MIT)
- `metadata.author`: Author/organization name (we use `wondelai`)
- `metadata.version`: Semantic version

The YAML frontmatter `description` field is critical for skill discovery - it should include keywords and trigger phrases that help match user requests to the skill. Single quotes in YAML values must be escaped by doubling them (`''`).

### Metaskill Format (the 12 guided journeys)

The 12 metaskills (create/improve/grow × business/website/app, improve-code-quality, remove-technical-debt, design-code-architecture) are **orchestrators, not book skills** — do not force-fit the book template above (no Scoring, Further Reading, or About the Author). Their SKILL.md sections, in order: intro → `## Core Principle` (the journey's sequencing law) → `## Journey Map` (Phase | Skill | Question it answers | Artifact) → `## Operating Rules` (rules 1–7 word-identical across all 12; rule 8 is the journey-specific guardrail) → `## Intake` → `## Phases` (each phase has six fields: Purpose, Brief (fallback), Invoke, Decide with the user, Artifact, Done when) → `## Optional Phases` → `## Common Mistakes` → `## Completing the Journey`. Descriptions follow a 5-sentence formula whose 4th sentence routes to sibling metaskills (negative triggers) — keep the routing mutually consistent when editing. Metaskills write UPPERCASE artifacts into the *user's project* `docs/` folder; the canonical skeletons and section headings live in [docs/ARTIFACT-REGISTRY.md](docs/ARTIFACT-REGISTRY.md) — artifact headings quoted in phases must match it, and each metaskill's `references/artifact-templates.md` copies the skeletons it creates.

## Adding New Skills

1. Create a new folder: `{skill-name}/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and skill instructions
3. Add `references/` folder with supporting `.md` files (each 1500-3000 words)
4. Add the skill to `README.md`:
   - Add to "Via skills.sh" installation list
   - Add row to "Available Skills" table
   - Add "Skill Details" section (description, About the author, Use when, Example prompts)
   - Add to "Copyright & Disclaimer" section
5. Add the skill's path to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under the appropriate plugin collection (add the `./skill-name` entry only — do **not** hand-pick a version; see Versioning Policy)
6. Run `scripts/sync-ide-skills.sh` — regenerates the IDE mirrors (`.claude/.cursor/.windsurf/.pi/.agents/.codex`) **and** the Codex plugin marketplace (`plugins/` + `.agents/plugins/` + `.codex/plugins/`). These are generated; never hand-edit them.

```

## Versioning Policy

Skills use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or complete rewrites
- **MINOR**: New features, significant enhancements, new sections
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, typo corrections, small clarifications

**Auto-increment rule:** When modifying a skill's `SKILL.md` or its `references/` files, always bump the version in the frontmatter:
- Content addition/enhancement → bump MINOR (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)
- Small fix/typo → bump PATCH (e.g., `1.1.0` → `1.1.1`)

Example:
```yaml
metadata:
  author: wondelai
  version: "1.1.0"
```

### Marketplace versions (automated)

The versions in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (top-level `metadata.version` and every `plugins[].version`) are **not** hand-edited. They are auto-synced to the latest GitHub release by `.github/workflows/sync-marketplace-version.yml`, which runs `scripts/sync-marketplace-versions.sh` on each published release and commits the result to `main`. To ship: bump the affected skills' `SKILL.md` versions, merge, then publish a `vX.Y.Z` GitHub release — the workflow sets all marketplace versions to `X.Y.Z`. To sync without a release, run `scripts/sync-marketplace-versions.sh X.Y.Z` locally.

## Commit Policy

Commit directly to main.
